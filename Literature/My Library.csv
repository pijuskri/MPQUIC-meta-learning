A lot of works have been made in this course. Quick UDP Internet Connection (QUIC) embeds stream multiplexing to solve the head-of-line blocking caused by the in-order requirement of TCP. Multipath-QUIC (MPQUIC) brings further improvements by utilizing multiple paths, as is done in MultiPath TCP (MPTCP). Different from MPTCP schedulers, MPQUIC schedulers are stream-aware and thus can provide finer granularity of multipath scheduling. As streams are with different features based on their contents, the resource preferences of a stream are highly related to its feature. We find that scheduling without the recognition of the stream features can aggravate inter-stream blocking when sharing paths. We fill this gap and propose PStream - a priority-based online stream scheduling mechanism for MPQUIC, which performs path scheduling based on the stream features. We examine the effectiveness of PStream under different path heterogeneity comparing to the original and the latest scheduler of MPQUIC. Our evaluation shows that our scheduler can reduce up to 25.4% of page load time in high path heterogeneity.","2020-08","2023-01-31 21:57:39","2023-01-31 21:57:39","","1-8","","","","","","PStream","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2637-9430","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>Stream feature based</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Performs path scheduling based on the stream features.

As its extension, Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) provides higher bandwidth and smoother network handover by using multiple network interfaces simultaneously. However, to improve HTTP traffic, there are still some issues not yet carefully addressed in the existing MPQUIC, and packet scheduling is a vital one among the issues. Specifically, existing methods fail to respond to the stream prioritization of HTTP Version 2 (HTTP/2), leading to unsatisfying web page load performance. Besides, managing asymmetric and dynamic network paths is also a challenging issue, which may result in Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking and excessive buffer usage if not effectively handled. In this paper, we present a stream-aware per-packet scheduler, HoL Blocking Eliminating Scheduler (HBES), to improve the performance of MPQUIC in mobile networks. Firstly, HBES provides a fair allocation of aggregated bandwidth for different streams based on their priority. Then, it keeps stream data arriving at the receiver in order by estimating packet arrival time to mitigate HoL blocking and excessive buffer usage. We implement HBES and evaluate its performance in various network scenarios. Experimental results verify the superiority of HBES in reducing stream completion time and buffer occupation over those existing MPQUIC schedulers.","2022","2023-01-31 22:01:41","2023-01-31 22:01:41","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Stream-aware per-packet scheduler.

With the prevalence of multi-homed devices such as smartphones with both WiFi and 4G/5G cellular connectivity, Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) can effectively utilize multiple network interfaces (i.e., multiple paths) to improve transmission efficiency. Current MPQUIC implementation adopts the Lowest-RTT-First (LRF) scheduler which always selects the path with the lowest smoothed RTT among all available paths. However, we show that in networks with heterogeneous paths where network characteristics (e.g., RTT, loss rate) differ considerably, such scheduling scheme leads to unnecessary waiting on fast paths and bufferbloat, degrading overall transmission performance significantly. To use heterogeneous paths efficiently (i.e., to reduce the overall file transfer completion time), this paper proposes a novel scheduling mechanism that assigns data to paths with transfer simulation without causing much additional overhead.

Multipath TCP (MPTCP) has been the de facto standard for utilizing multipaths, and Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC), which is an extension of the Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol, has become a promising replacement due to its various advantages. The multipath scheduler, which determines the path to which each packet should be transmitted, is a key function that affects the multipath transport performance. For example, the default minRTT scheduler typically achieves good throughput, while the redundant scheduler gains low latency. While the legacy schedulers may generally give a desirable performance in some environments, however, each application renders different requirements. For example, Web applications target low latency, while video streaming applications require low jitter and high video quality. In this paper, we propose a novel MPQUIC scheduler based on deep reinforcement learning using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) that enhances the quality of multimedia streaming. Our proposal first takes into account both delay and throughput as a reward for reinforcement learning to achieve a low video chunk download time. Second, we propose a chunk manager that informs the scheduler of the video chunk information, and we also tune the learning parameters to explore new random actions adequately. Finally, we implement our new scheduler on the Linux kernel and give results using the Mininet experiments. The evaluation results show that our proposal outperforms legacy schedulers by at least 20%.","2022-01","2023-01-31 23:14:40","2023-01-31 23:14:40","2023-01-31 23:14:40","6333","","17","22","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 17 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>RL, chunk manager</p> <p>Chunk manager that informs the scheduler of the video chunk information, Deep Q-Network. <span style=""color: rgb(32, 33, 36)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Solves DQN overhead by mutlithreading, periodically synchronizing online, target and prediction policies.

The scheduler of a multipath transport protocol determines how to distribute data packets over different paths. Existing multipath schedulers either conform to predefined policies or to online trained policies. The adoption of millimeter wave (mmWave) paths in 5th Generation (5G) networks and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) introduces time-varying network conditions, under which the existing schedulers struggle to achieve fast and accurate adaptation. In this paper, we propose FALCON, a learning-based multipath scheduler that can adapt fast and accurately to time-varying network conditions. FALCON builds on the idea of meta-learning where offline learning is used to create a set of meta-models that represent coarse-grained network conditions, and online learning is used to bootstrap a specific model for the current fine-grained network conditions towards deriving the scheduling policy to deal with such conditions. Using trace-driven emulation experiments, we demonstrate FALCON outperforms the best state-of-the-art scheduler by up to 19.3% and 23.6% in static and mobile networks, respectively. Furthermore, we show FALCON is quite flexible to work with different types of applications such as bulk transfer and web services. Moreover, we observe FALCON has a much faster adaptation time compared to all the other learning-based schedulers, reaching almost an 8-fold speedup compared to the best of them. Finally, we have validated the emulation results in real-world settings illustrating that FALCON adapts well to the dynamicity of real networks, consistently outperforming all other schedulers.","2022-01-22","2023-01-31 23:29:02","2023-01-31 23:29:02","2023-01-31 23:29:02","","","","","","","FALCON","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2201.08969 [cs]","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>On and Off- line learning, DQN</p> <p>Meta-learning where offline learning is used to create a set of meta-models that represent coarse-grained network conditions, and online learning is used to bootstrap a specific model for the current fine-grained network conditions.</p> </div>","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\IZJAAB24\Wu et al. - 2022 - FALCON Fast and Accurate Multipath Scheduling usi.pdf; C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\IKVLP53J\2201.html","","","Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2201.08969","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In MPQUIC, the scheduler, which is in charge of concurrently scheduling data transmission in several paths, largely impacts the protocols’ performance, especially in dynamic environments. In fact, in the literature, a considerable number of MTP schedulers for MPQUIC have been proposed. Unfortunately, their performances have been primarily evaluated in static networks without (or simply) considering mobile ones. Hence, this work attempts to investigate the performance of MPQUIC schedulers in the mobile context, aiming to fill the literature gap. Specifically, we implement and assess the performance of five MPQUIC schedulers in various mobility patterns using the Mininet-WiFi emulator. More importantly, we introduce q-ReLeS, an extension of an MPTCP scheduler called ReLeS for MPQUIC.

However, most existing works assume both tasks are sampled from a stationary task distribution, thereby leading to the sub-optimal performance for dynamic tasks drawn from a non-stationary task distribution in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study a more realistic and challenging transfer learning setting with dynamic tasks, i.e., source and target tasks are continuously evolving over time. We theoretically show that the expected error on the dynamic target task can be tightly bounded in terms of source knowledge and consecutive distribution discrepancy across tasks. This result motivates us to propose a generic meta-learning framework L2E for modeling the knowledge transferability on dynamic tasks. It is centered around a task-guided meta-learning problem with a group of meta-pairs of tasks, based on which we are able to learn the prior model initialization for fast adaptation on the newest target task. L2E enjoys the following properties: (1) effective knowledge transferability across dynamic tasks; (2) fast adaptation to the new target task; (3) mitigation of catastrophic forgetting on historical target tasks; and (4) flexibility in incorporating any existing static transfer learning algorithms. Extensive experiments on various image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed L2E framework.","2022-07-04","2023-02-05 14:51:59","2023-02-05 14:51:59","2023-02-05 14:51:59","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2207.01784 [cs]","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>RL algo with meta learning</p> <p></p> <p>same author, new model:</p> <p>“Dynamic transfer learning with progressive meta-task scheduler”</p> </div>","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\FALB7HHB\Wu and He - 2022 - A Unified Meta-Learning Framework for Dynamic Tran.pdf; C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\24I34IBR\2207.html; ","https://github.com/jwu4sml/l2e","","Computer Science - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2207.01784","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, researchers spend inordinate amounts of time on implementing software rather than understanding and developing new ideas.

It addresses how to choose an item among multiple scheduling items in each timestep to achieve a long-term goal. Conventional approaches for dynamic scheduling find the optimal policy for a given specific system so that the policy from these approaches is usable only for the corresponding system characteristics. Hence, it is hard to use such approaches for a practical system in which system characteristics dynamically change. This paper proposes a novel policy structure for MDP-based dynamic scheduling, a descriptive policy, which has a system-agnostic capability to adapt to unseen system characteristics for an identical task (dynamic scheduling). To this end, the descriptive policy learns a system-agnostic scheduling principle--in a nutshell, ""which condition of items should have a higher priority in scheduling"". The scheduling principle can be applied to any system so that the descriptive policy learned in one system can be used for another system. Experiments with simple explanatory and realistic application scenarios demonstrate that it enables system-agnostic meta-learning with very little performance degradation compared with the system-specific conventional policies.","2022-01-24","2023-02-08 11:06:52","2023-02-08 11:06:52","2023-02-08 11:06:52","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2201.07051 [cs, stat]","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>scheduling meta learning</p> <p></p> </div>","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\SHTCXJC7\Lee - 2022 - System-Agnostic Meta-Learning for MDP-based Dynami.pdf; C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\KGEBA23D\2201.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning; Statistics - Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2201.07051","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the state-of-the-art multipath schedulers face the challenges when dealing with dynamic path behaviors (i.e., packet loss, fluctuation of delay) and heterogeneous path characteristics. In this paper, we propose Peekaboo, a multipath scheduler that is aware of the dynamic characteristics of the heterogeneous paths and learns the corresponding strategy for the current dynamicity level, from both deterministic and stochastic perspectives. We implement Peekaboo in Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) and compare it with state-of-the-art multipath schedulers for a wide range of dynamicity levels, upon both emulated and real networks.

In this paper, we present Spine, a hierarchical congestion control algorithm that fully utilizes the performance gain from deep reinforcement learning but with ultralow overhead. At its heart, Spine decouples the congestion control task into two subtasks in different timescales and handles them with different components: i) a lightweight CC executor that performs fine-grained control responding to dynamic bandwidth changes, and ii) an RL agent that works at a coarse-grained level that generates control sub-policies for the CC executor. Such two-level control architecture can provide fine-grained DRL-based control with a low model inference overhead. Real-world experiments and emulations show that Spine achieves consistent high performance across various network conditions with an ultra-low control overhead reduced by at least 80% compared to its DRL-based counterparts, similar to classic CC schemes such as Cubic.","2022-11-30","2023-02-16 12:57:50","2023-02-16 12:57:50","2023-02-16 12:57:50","261-275","","","","","","Spine","","","","","ACM","Roma Italy","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\SV5LCLCL\Tian et al. - 2022 - Spine an efficient DRL-based congestion control w.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CoNEXT '22: The 18th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scalable Video Coding (SVC) encodes a video segment into multi-layer, and different layers can be transmitted on heterogeneous paths. SVC has great potential to make use of the multipath protocol. Meanwhile, multipath QUIC (MPQUIC) provides multiplexing and instant handshake compared with multipath transmission control protocol (MPTCP). Thus MPQUIC has great potential in Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) with SVC. However, mismatches between streams with different priorities and paths, network congestion caused by the suddenly increased data traffic are new challenges of MPQUIC for DASH-SVC. Adaptive Stream-scheduler Multipath QUIC (ASMQ) framework is proposed to improve the user’s QoE in DASH-SVC, prioritizing the streams based on the DASH-SVC application information and evaluates the qualities of multipath. ASMQ schedule prioritized streams to the path with different qualities. In addition, the server-client feedback mechanism of ASMQ can adapt to network congestion conditions in real-time. Emulation with real network traces demonstrates that the ASMQ improves user’s QoE compared to MPTCP and traditional MPQUIC.","2021-10","2023-02-16 13:23:28","2023-02-16 13:23:28","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2374-9628","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>wifi and 4g traces</p> </div>","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\3LHAM8DJ\footnotes.html; C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\BGKTMMCK\Yang et al. - 2021 - Adaptive Video Streaming with Scalable Video Codin.pdf","","","MPQUIC; Multiplexing; Protocols; Schedules; Prefetching; QoE; Static VAr compensators; Stream scheduler; Streaming media; Video coding; Video streaming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many efforts have been made to optimize their performances. Multipath video streaming that simultaneously utilizes multiple wireless networks for video content delivery is a common method. Another effective approach is the cross-layer video streaming optimization that jointly takes the parameters at different protocol layers into account. However, multipath streaming schemes mainly focus on how to efficiently utilize multiple wireless networks and the collaboration of parameters at different layers in each network is neglected. Likewise, the cross-layer schemes normally optimize the parameters at different layers in purely one network without fully utilizing the aggregated bandwidths of multiple available wireless networks. Therefore, both of them are sub-optimal and might suffer from degrading performance. In this paper, we propose a joint Cross-layer DASH-based multipath video streaming scheme that takes advantage of bandwidth aggregation of multiple wireless networks and further improves the performance by optimizing the different layers’ parameters in each network with a cross-layer manner. In the proposed scheme, the LTE and 802.11ac networks are adopted.

Two distinct research paradigms have studied this question. Meta-learning views this problem as learning a prior over model parameters that is amenable for fast adaptation on a new task, but typically assumes the set of tasks are available together as a batch. In contrast, online (regret based) learning considers a sequential setting in which problems are revealed one after the other, but conventionally train only a single model without any task-specific adaptation. This work introduces an online meta-learning setting, which merges ideas from both the aforementioned paradigms to better capture the spirit and practice of continual lifelong learning. We propose the follow the meta leader algorithm which extends the MAML algorithm to this setting. Theoretically, this work provides an $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret guarantee with only one additional higher order smoothness assumption in comparison to the standard online setting. Our experimental evaluation on three different large-scale tasks suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms alternatives based on traditional online learning approaches.","2019-07-03","2023-02-16 17:36:21","2023-02-16 17:36:21","2023-02-16 17:36:21","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1902.08438 [cs, stat]","Comment: ICML 2019.

Ensuring Quality of Experience (QoE) is quite challenging due to varying bandwidth and time constraints. Since most of today’s mobile devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces, one promising approach is to benefit from multipath communications. Multipathing leads to higher aggregate bandwidth and distributing video traffic over multiple network paths improves stability, seamless connectivity, and QoE. However, most of current transport protocols do not match the requirements of video streaming applications or are not designed to address relevant issues, such as networks heterogeneity, head-of-line blocking, and delay constraints. In this comprehensive survey, we first review video streaming standards and technology developments. We then discuss the benefits and challenges of multipath video transmission over wireless. We provide a holistic literature review of multipath wireless video streaming, shedding light on the different alternatives from an end-to-end layered stack perspective, reviewing key multipath wireless scheduling functions, unveiling trade-offs of each approach, and presenting a suitable taxonomy to classify the state-of-the-art.

Despite their popularity, studies have shown that performance of video streams still suffers from stalls, quality switches and startup delay. In wireless networks, it is well-known that high variability in network bandwidth affects video streaming. MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an emerging paradigm that could offer significant benefits to video streaming by combining bandwidth on multiple network interfaces, in particular for mobile devices that typically support both WiFi and cellular networks. In this paper, we explore whether MPTCP always benefits mobile video streaming. Our experimental study on video streaming using two wireless interfaces yields mixed results. While beneficial to user experience under ample and stable bandwidth, MPTCP may not offer any advantage under some network conditions. We find that when additional bandwidth on the secondary path is not sufficient to sustain an upgrade in video quality, it is generally better not to use MPTCP. We also identify that MPTCP can harm user experience when an unstable secondary path is added to the stable primary path.","2016-09","2023-02-16 18:06:33","2023-02-16 18:06:33","","331-336","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2375-0227","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\5QVJM8K7\James et al. - 2016 - Is Multipath TCP (MPTCP) Beneficial for Video Stre.pdf","","","Bandwidth; Delays; Protocols; Servers; TCP; MPTCP; Streaming media; Adaptive Streaming; Cellular; DASH; HTTP; IEEE 802.11 Standard; Mobile; Mobile communication; Video; WiFi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various multipath schedulers have been proposed, and each of them usually outperforms the others in each specific scenario. To provide a generic approach with the best performance and stability, a novel one is introduced in this paper and aimed to fill this research gap.

The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, ""meta"" refers to training multiple tasks, and ""transfer"" is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5-shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.","2019-04-09","2023-04-08 14:39:21","2023-04-08 14:39:21","2023-04-08 14:39:21","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1812.02391 [cs]","Comment: CVPR 2019","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\TL3LK8ZV\Sun et al. - 2019 - Meta-Transfer Learning for Few-Shot Learning.pdf; C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\EF8EITT8\1812.html","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1812.02391","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Owing to TCP's reliable service, the picture and sound quality would not be degraded by network impairments, such as high delay and packet loss. However, the network impairments can cause rebuffering events which would result in jerky playback and deform the video's temporal structure. These quality degradations could adversely affect users' quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we investigate the relationship among three levels of quality of service (QoS) of HTTP video streaming: network QoS, application QoS, and user QoS (i.e., QoE). Our ultimate goal is to understand how the network QoS affects the QoE of HTTP video streaming. Our approach is to first characterize the correlation between the application and network QoS using analytical models and empirical evaluation. The second step is to perform subjective experiments to evaluate the relationship between application QoS and QoE. Our analysis reveals that the frequency of rebuffering is the main factor responsible for the variations in the QoE.","2011-05","2023-04-19 09:14:48","2023-04-19 09:14:48","","485-492","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1573-0077","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\4ISQIW4G\5990550.html; C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\36TGYGBY\Mok et al. - 2011 - Measuring the quality of experience of HTTP video .pdf","","","Streaming media; Quality of service; Codecs; Games; Reliability; TV; Web sites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2011) and Workshops","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this goal, we conducted a pilot subjective user study simulating a video streaming service over a broadband network with varying distortion scenarios, namely packet losses (0, 0.5, 1, 3,7, and 15%), packet reorder (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30%), and coding bit rates (100, 400, 600, and 800 Kbps). Users were asked to rate their experience using a subjective quantitative metric (termed Perceived Video Quality, PVQ) and qualitative indicators of “experience.” Simulation results suggest a) an exponential relationship between PVQ and packet loss and between PVQ and packet reorder, and b) a logarithmic relationship between PVQ and video bit rate. Similar trends were observed with the qualitative indicators. Exploratory analysis with two objective video quality metrics suggests that trends similar to those obtained with the subjective ratings were obtained, particularly with a full-reference metric.","2012-12","2023-04-19 09:14:03","2023-04-19 09:14:03","","1-9","","","","","","Quality-of-Experience perception for video streaming services","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\YEF79CAU\6411949.html; C:\Users\Admin\Zotero\storage\342XP2QG\Laghari et al. - 2012 - Quality-of-Experience perception for video streami.pdf","","","Packet loss; Streaming media; Quality of service; Humans; Quality assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of The 2012 Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
