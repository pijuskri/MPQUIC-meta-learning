the DICE model uses A2C with a linear reg. critic, replace with fully NN one

modified cherry files:
torch_wrapper.py
runner_wrapper.py
__init__.py

#04/27
avalance-rl files:
rl_scenario.py (due to gym vs gymnasium)
env_wrappers.py (due to use of gym=0.21)

dqn.py, line 126. For some reason number of rollouts its not considered
rl_base_strategy.py, line 494. Should not reset before close
rl_base_strategy.py, line 397. Eval every cant be zero cause modulo

issues with reset, perhaps modify server to send an initial network observation?

#04/28
Calling reset before closes causes issues. Can be fixed by making initial observation be based on topo used by env.

for some reason docker now works, before was stuck on starting engine. Perhaps installing docker on wsl made it work?
Yep that was the reason. I had added wsl integration with both default and test distros. It tried to run the non default distro but it did not have docker correctly set up.
happened again. What fixed it was wsl --shutdown while docker still starting or going to ubuntu and running docker there
indeed seems like shutting down, docker stats on ubuntu and then starting docker desktop makes it work.

seems when running docker through wsl, ssh without password does not work. Git bash might be bad cause /lib/modules cant be accessed
running local docker on wsl seems to work
do not forget to install kernel modules
mptcp v0 is used by the code provided, while the kernel has mptcp v1. The latest supported version of mptcp v0 is 5.4

trying microsoft 5.4 kernel

Ok no more docker. The compiled kernel does not work on wsl. Moving on to VM

converting my own video is causing issues cause mp4box outputs a specific (and more modern) mpd file, 
while astream does not support it. Time to change astream code...
to anyone reading this, do not use Astream. It has terrible code for reading mpd files.
decided to hack the sara format support instead, do not do this!!!!
sara and netflix dont have something in the mpd, they fail
with the current video the blasic dash playback causes a lot of issues with jumping between low and higher bitrate. Difference between bitrates is 3x.

#05/19
netflix now works, the code was just dumb. It does seem to buffer for a long time

could try using a unified qoe evaluation model https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.uba.uva.nl/document/8666971

use 5g dataset, use bandwith and average ping. Replace nan ping/loss values. Do second pass and do a moving average(window=15) over the ping and loss. Min Bandwith of 50kb.
Only download

the vm is absolutely cursed, installing packages with python does not work. 

#05/23
seems other people simply provide very high quality video to cause full use of bandwith, gonna do that too probably. (https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.uba.uva.nl/document/7546928)
