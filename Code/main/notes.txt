the DICE model uses A2C with a linear reg. critic, replace with fully NN one

modified cherry files:
torch_wrapper.py
runner_wrapper.py
__init__.py

#04/27
avalance-rl files:
rl_scenario.py (due to gym vs gymnasium)
env_wrappers.py (due to use of gym=0.21)

dqn.py, line 126. For some reason number of rollouts its not considered
rl_base_strategy.py, line 494. Should not reset before close
rl_base_strategy.py, line 397. Eval every cant be zero cause modulo

issues with reset, perhaps modify server to send an initial network observation?

#04/28
Calling reset before closes causes issues. Can be fixed by making initial observation be based on topo used by env.

for some reason docker now works, before was stuck on starting engine. Perhaps installing docker on wsl made it work?
Yep that was the reason. I had added wsl integration with both default and test distros. It tried to run the non default distro but it did not have docker correctly set up.
